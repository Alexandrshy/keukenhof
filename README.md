# Como north

GitHub template for starting new projects üèûÔ∏è

## Getting Started

Create your repository and clone this project there

```
git clone git@github.com:Alexandrshy/coma_test-2.git
```

Change the project name and links in the `pakcage.json` file so that the auto-publishing of your package works correctly

```diff
package.json
{
-      "name": "como-north",
+      "name": "new-poject",
       "repository": {
           "type": "git",
-          "url": "https://github.com/Alexandrshy/como-north"
+          "url": "https://github.com/author/new-poject"
       },
       "bugs": {
-          "url": "https://github.com/Alexandrshy/como-north/issues"
+          "url": "https://github.com/author/new-poject/issues"
       },
-      "homepage": "https://github.com/Alexandrshy/como-north",
+      "homepage": "https://github.com/author/new-poject",
}
```

For the actions to work correctly, you need to add two constants:
